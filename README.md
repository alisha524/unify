# unify

This application would allow users to manage a hackathon event from start to finish. It would allow for event creation and management, team creation and management, and task management. This application would also include a messaging system to allow for communication between event organizers, teams, and individuals. The application also allows the users to track their progress and see the results of the hackathons.
